Quickie
=======

QUICKSTART
==========

Copy the "Words.xml" file to "C:\". Run the QuickieDemo.exe binary.

To use a different WordsProvider, such as the dummy one, edit
PhraseBuilder.cs

Use NUnit to run the testcases.

NOTES
=====

*	There are a number of FIXME comments in the code; read them!

*	Character groupings could be broken out to a configration
	file

*	The form should probably be designed and rendered dynamically,
	based on that configuration

*	Letters are uppercased by default

*	The reading of the XML word list has been built very rapidly
	-- there's no proper exception handling -- and there's no
	clever mechanism for finding the words file

*	Inline commenting isn't that thorough as I much prefer formal
	documentating in UML (with Visio) and with Word, but didn't have
	time to generate it

*	Extra symbols can easily be added to the the {space} character
	grouping by editing the line that defines the grouping
	
*	The WordsProvider / PhraseBuilder interface is quite weakly
	defined
