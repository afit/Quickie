Quickie: Predictive text entry engine
=====================================

What is Quickie?
----------------

Quickie is a simple engine for providing predictive text entry, similar to the systems employed by many mobile phones. A simple numeric keypad can be used to input phrases.

The engine doesn't do anything particularly clever.

Quickie is Open Source, written in C#, and is subject to the GPL.

What does it look like?
-----------------------

Well, it doesn't really look like anything. It's a DLL. The little demonstration application, QuickieDemo, looks much like this:
